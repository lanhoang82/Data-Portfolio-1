# Exploring and transforming data in LEGO Database using pandas
![40516](https://github.com/lanhoang82/Data-Portfolio-1/assets/47191803/00472e33-7df1-4682-8bbf-904c39b54b95)

### Context:
LEGO is a popular brand of toy building bricks. They are often sold in sets in order to build a specific object. Each set contains a number of parts in different shapes, sizes and colors. This database contains information on which parts are included in different LEGO sets. It was originally compiled to help people who owned some LEGO sets already figure out what other sets they could build with the pieces they had.

### Content:
This dataset contains the LEGO Parts/Sets/Colors and Inventories of every official LEGO set in the Rebrickable database. These files are current as of July 2017 and made available on Kaggle at the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/lego-database). 

### Acknowledgements:
This dataset was compiled by Rebrickable, which is a website to help identify what LEGO sets can be built given bricks and pieces from other LEGO sets.

### Questions that this project aims to answer:

##### Theme Analysis:

1. Which are the top 5 themes with the most number of sets?
2. How has the number of sets released in each of the above themes changed over time?
3. What are the average and maximum number of pieces in sets for each of the above themes?
4. Which themes have the highest and lowest average number of pieces per set?

##### Parts Analysis:

1. What are the top 10 most commonly used parts in LEGO sets?
2. How has the availability of different parts changed over the years?
3. Which parts are used across multiple themes, and how many themes do they appear in?
4. What is the distribution of part categories in the dataset?

##### Color Analysis:

1. What are the most frequently used colors in LEGO sets?
2. How does the color distribution differ across different themes?
3. What is the average number of colors used in sets for each theme?
4. How has the usage of different colors changed over the years?

##### Set Analysis:

1. What is the distribution of the number of pieces in LEGO sets?
2. How does the average price of sets vary with the number of pieces?
3. Is there a correlation between the number of pieces and the average user rating of sets?
4. How has the average price of sets changed over time?
