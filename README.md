This repository is a portfolio of selected personal data-related projects I have completeted in the following areas:
- Data analysis - using SQL and Python
- Data visualization - using Tableau
- Machine Learning - Classification Prediction using Python

This portfolio is still a work in progress, so more projects will be coming soon as I expand/deepen my skillset :)

## I. Data analysis - using SQL

Apart from the SQL projects below, I'm currently taking up an [8-week SQL challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/). You can check out my progress at my other GitHub repository **[here](https://github.com/lanhoang82/8-Week-SQL-Challenge)**.

### 1. HR Analytics - A more advanced SQL Project 

With a database of 7 tables hosted on PostgreSQL, this SQL project aims to showcase my ability to write more advanced SQL queries. Via pgAdmin 4, I write queries with common types of joins, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs) and window functions. A toy HR analytics database was employed to practice providing relevant insights and help management to answer questions that would inform personnel and compensation policies, such as:

- How many employees in the company have earned more than the average salary of their respective department?
- What is the geographical distribution of the employees in the company (by city, country or region)? 
- What is the salary range of the employees in the IT department?
- Who is the employee who has been with the company the longest? Who is the most recently joined employee?

This project is ongoing as I practice and improve my SQL skills. New queries uncovering new aspects of the database will continue to be added.

### 1.1. Insights from ESG Indicators - A SQL Project

Situated in a Jupyter notebook in the SQL/ESG folder above, this SQL project aims to put in practice and demonstrate my ability to write basic SQL queries. This is done through obtaining insights from ESG (Environment/Social/Governance) indicators. These insights are intended to help shareholders and investors better understand how these ESG indicators evolve over time and compare companies in the same sector for benchmarking.

The project uses a dummy data set obtained from Tableau Exchange at the following link: https://exchange.tableau.com/fr-FR/products/625. The SQL queries, hosted on SQLite, would help answer the following key business questions:

- Where are we on environmental/social issues/governance?
- Where are we in terms of CO2 emissions?
- How many companies have at least one social policy?
- What is the percentage of women on the board of directors?
- How is my company performing compared to companies in the same industry?
